# üì¶ Warehouse Management App

Java-based backend application built with the Spring Framework and managed using Maven. It follows a layered architecture consisting of controllers, services, entities, repositories (DAO), and DTOs. The backend is designed with a RESTful architecture using Spring MVC to handle HTTP requests
and is connected to a MySQL relational database. Spring Data JPA is used to abstract and simplify database operations through repository interfaces. CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are implemented for core entities such as Warehouses, Racks, Products, ImportsExports, and Reports,
allowing comprehensive data management. DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) are used to decouple backend entities from the data exposed to the client, enhancing security and flexibility. The application is intended to support a warehouse management system with features like adding and organizing 
products, fast search capabilities, generating import/export reports, and monitoring stock levels. It is built to work alongside an Angular-based frontend, forming a full-stack solution.
